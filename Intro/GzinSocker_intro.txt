Hey! My name is Gabriel!

I'm just a student, I study in Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais.

I'm from Brazil... and no, here there isn't only forest, samba and football.

I'm insterested in Web and Mobile Develpment, and I also like AI.

I'm really happy to make a contribution in this procject, because I'm pretty new in coding.

For everyone who is starting as me, happy HacktoberFest 2020!!!
