Hello!
I'm Akshat from Delhi, India. 
Currently, I'm pursuing B.Tech Computer Science and IIID, Delhi.
I'm a coding enthusiast. I code in C++. I started coding from my high school and since then I'm in love with it.
These days, I'm honing my DS and Algo skills.
I'm also interested System Design and hence working on it too. 
I'm just too excited to be a part of HacktoberFest 2020!!
